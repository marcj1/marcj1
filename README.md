But I guess a good billet makes this more beautiful. I've started a Github account, I've been looking how this works for a while and learning how not to fucking disgust and make content that at least doesn't waste your time.

I love using social media, I like it so much that sometimes I want to shove whole profiles straight up my ass; Sometimes it also disgusts me, I have creative crises, I can't do anything decent and I want to blow my fucking brains out. But overall it's cool. What I'm trying to say is that I wish I could do my best.

As if that weren't enough, this surprises me again and again, discovering with an adult mind how intelligent and ingenious some things are, videogames or things that I enjoyed in my childhood; or the revolutionary news that appear from where I least expect it. Have you played Undertale? As they end up releasing a physical version of the game, you can imagine where it will actually end up on my ass.

But despite all that I have received from writing, there is a barrier, it is called time and it is giving me the ass. You sure weren't expecting to learn so much about my ass in this text. What a Johnny like me shouldn't give a damn for anyone, what would I have believed. I am not special. Ok, ok I have made an effort in my social media ... like so many others with theirs and so many people in their respective occupations. If you keep reading despite this, reconsider whether to follow me.

Imagine this, a future where Github has just turned into a portal for the sale of dildos online due to a computer error, its successor Hubgit is now a dunghill invaded by neo-streamers with gigantic necklines who react to horrible video games sponsored by big clothing brands. At 97 years old, I have to be relegated to the last refuge, upload what little I have left to pornographic pages without sufficient security measures, and I can do it thanks to the fact that you are really going to follow me!

Isn‘t it beautiful? No. FOLLOW ME !!!
